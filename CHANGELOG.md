## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.10] - 2020-01-26
### Added
- Raw datasets are now cached on download, and processed datasets cached after processing, and always checked against MD5 for integrity.
- Tests now exist for utils.py

## [0.0.9] - 2020-01-26
### Added
- UK 2017 General Election dataset (**`general-election/UK/2017/results`**).
- Some tests (that really need caching!).
### Changed
- Now using data from the [House of Commons Library](https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-8647).
- The basic processed election results are now "long form" with less but more standardised information.
- The full election results are (for now) no longer provided.
- Lots of refactoring with some new base classes & utils making it faster to add new datasets.

## [0.0.8] - 2019-11-14
### Fixes
- Electoral Commission [no longer hosts 2010 GE results](https://github.com/john-sandall/maven/pull/15) so use our fallback until a new primary can be found.
- Fixed URL to EC's 2015 GE results.

## [0.0.7] - 2019-11-14
### Added
- Tests added to setup.py.
### Changed
- Switched to using [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) instead of Pipenv for generating requirements.txt & locking dependencies.

## [0.0.6] - 2019-07-13
### Added
- `general-election/UK/2015/model`: model-ready datasets for the 2015/2017 UK General Elections.
- Regional polling datasets.

## [0.0.5] - 2019-07-13
### Added
- Basic tests for `get.py`
- Additional processing for the GE2015 results pipeline to generate a more useful dataset for common election modelling tasks.
- Added `general-election/UK/2010/results` dataset.
### Changed
- API design for dataset identifiers to use dash/slash instead of underscore/dash and capitalised country codes to make it clearer these will be ISO 3166 Alpha-2 codes, e.g. `general_election-gb-2015-results` -> `general-election/GB/2015/results`.
- Changed GB to UK everywhere as these results are full UK results including Northern Ireland.

## [0.0.4] - 2019-07-07
### Fixes
- Fixed relative imports and switch to using a class for each dataset.

## [0.0.3] - 2019-07-07
### Added
- Improved README.

## [0.0.2] - 2019-07-07
### Added
- UK 2015 General Election dataset (**`general_election-gb-2015-results`**).
- Proper README plus data dictionary.
- MANIFEST.in plus additional packaging info and this changelog.

## [0.0.1] - 2019-07-07
### Added
- Barebones functionality, Python package requirements (setup.py, Pipfile, .gitignore, LICENSE)
